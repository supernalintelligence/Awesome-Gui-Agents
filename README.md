## What are GUI Compute Agents?

GUI compute agents are AI systems designed to interact with graphical user interfaces just like humans do. They can:
- See and understand screen elements
- Click buttons, type text, and drag elements
- Navigate through applications and websites
- Complete complex visual workflows
- Automate GUI-based tasks through natural language instructions
